outcome: "Extended examples/demo with end-to-end world streaming proof scene. Built multi-room indoor dungeon (Room 0 Entry Hall and Room 1 Seam Tunnel connected via room graph hop), registered a 2D rigid transform seam at (0, -8) mapping room coordinates to outdoor terrain at (32, 32), wired FlatChunkProvider outdoor data source, and configured streaming tuning params (load radius 2, evict radius 3, hop depth 1, seam trigger 32.0). Extended PerfOverlay with live world structure ('Indoor'/'Outdoor'), room ID, resident counts, and tuning controls. Verified walking player from indoor room through seam to 5x5 outdoor terrain chunks and back works symmetrically with zero load screens, freezes, or pop-in at normal frame rate. Verified pnpm test, pnpm typecheck, and pnpm --filter demo build."

# Demo World Streaming Proof Scene

Extend `examples/demo` to prove `docs/architecture/world-streaming.md`'s design end to end: a player walks from an indoor dungeon room, through a seam, into outdoor chunked terrain (and back), with resident data streaming in/out and no load screen or level swap, mirroring task:25's visibility proof scene pattern.

## Desired Changes

- Extend `examples/demo`'s scene with at least two connected indoor rooms (proving task:28's room-graph streaming across a hop) and an outdoor area spanning multiple chunks (proving task:27's chunk streaming across chunk boundaries), joined by at least one seam (task:29)
- Use the reference `ChunkProvider` from task:26 (or a demo-specific placeholder implementation of the same interface) to source outdoor chunk data — this is the natural place to demonstrate the pluggable-source pattern from `docs/architecture/world-streaming.md`
- Wire the streaming tuning config (task:30) with concrete demo-appropriate values (small enough radii/depths to observably stream during normal movement in the demo's scene scale)
- Ensure the existing render/input loop (per `docs/architecture/wasm-bridge.md` and `docs/architecture/input-schema.md`) drives movement across all of the above with no special-cased "load screen" state or discrete scene swap

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Player can walk from the demo's starting indoor room, through at least one other connected room, through a seam, into outdoor terrain spanning at least 2 chunks in each direction from the seam, with no load screen, freeze, or discrete transition visible during normal frame-rate movement
- [ ] Walking back through the seam into indoor space works symmetrically
- [ ] Manual verification (documented in this task's outcome) confirms no visible pop-in of geometry at normal movement speed, given the configured load-ahead radii/trigger distance
- [ ] Demo scene construction (rooms, chunks, seam, config values) is committed as part of `examples/demo`
- [ ] Existing demo build/run instructions still work; `pnpm` scripts for the demo succeed

## Out of Scope

- New engine-core streaming mechanics — this task only assembles and configures a scene using task:26–30's existing capabilities
- Automated visual regression testing — manual verification is sufficient, matching task:25's precedent
- Production-quality terrain/room content — placeholder/minimal geometry is sufficient to prove the streaming mechanics, per `docs/research/known-gaps.md`'s "Example Demo Scope" entry

## Implementation Steps

1. Read `docs/architecture/world-streaming.md` in full, and review task:25's visibility proof scene for the established demo-proof pattern
2. Extend `examples/demo`'s scene data with the multi-room, multi-chunk, seam-connected layout described above
3. Wire the reference/placeholder `ChunkProvider` (task:26) as the outdoor data source for the demo
4. Configure streaming tuning values (task:30) appropriate to the demo's scale
5. Run the demo, walk the full indoor→seam→outdoor→seam→indoor path, confirm no load screen/freeze/pop-in at normal movement speed
6. Record verification results in this task's `outcome` field on completion

## Context

**Read first:**
- `docs/architecture/world-streaming.md` — source of truth for what this scene must prove
- task:25's demo visibility proof scene — established pattern for demo-based design-doc proof tasks
- `docs/research/known-gaps.md`'s "Example Demo Scope" entry — scope precedent for demo content minimality

**Related work:**
- task:26, task:27, task:28, task:29, task:30 (dependencies: this task exercises all of them together)
